Project: The incredible world of Bush House
Authors: Louis Mellac, Andrei Cinca, Michael KÃ¶lling, and David J. Barnes

This project is a simple predator-prey simulation involving students, lecturers,
admin staff, KCLSU students, and teaching assistants in an enclosed rectangular field.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 2000 steps.
